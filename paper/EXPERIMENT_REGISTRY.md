# EXPERIMENT_REGISTRY

Every experiment in this project appears here, before it runs and after it
finishes. A failed hypothesis stays in this file with its original text intact.
We do not rewrite history to make the final approach look inevitable.

## Rules

1. An experiment may not run until its `PLAN.md` exists under
   `experiments/<ID>/` and is committed. The commit SHA of that preregistration
   is what makes it a preregistration.
2. The plan is never edited after the run. Deviations go in `RESULT.md` under
   "deviations from plan", with the reason.
3. Results are recorded whether they support the hypothesis or not.
4. An experiment that hits its kill criterion is marked `KILLED` and stays
   listed. The kill is a finding.

## Preregistration template

Copy into `experiments/<ID>/PLAN.md`. All sixteen fields are mandatory; "not
applicable" is an acceptable value but silence is not.

```
1.  Experiment identifier
2.  Research question
3.  Falsifiable hypothesis
4.  Theoretical motivation
5.  Relationship to prior work
6.  Exact baseline
7.  Exact intervention
8.  Training split
9.  Validation split
10. Held-out evaluation split
11. Leakage risks
12. Compute budget
13. Success criterion
14. Kill criterion
15. Intended paper claim
16. Possible negative interpretation
```

## Result template

Copy into `experiments/<ID>/RESULT.md`.

```
1.  Commit SHA (of the code that ran)
2.  Exact configuration
3.  Exact command
4.  Random seeds
5.  Runtime
6.  Hardware
7.  Results
8.  Confidence intervals
9.  Per-task breakdown (path to artifact)
10. Failure categories (per paper/FAILURE_TAXONOMY.md)
11. Claims supported / weakened / rejected (cross-ref paper/CLAIM_LEDGER.md)
12. Artifact paths
13. Candidate table or figure (cross-ref paper/FIGURE_REGISTRY.md)
14. Follow-up justified by the evidence
15. Deviations from plan, and why
```

## Registry

| ID | Title | Status | Preregistration SHA | Result | Claims touched |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EXP001 | Solver complementarity and selection-oracle headroom on ARC-AGI-2 | PREREGISTERED | see `experiments/EXP001/PLAN.md` | pending | C1, C2, C3 |

Status values: `PREREGISTERED`, `RUNNING`, `COMPLETE`, `KILLED`, `ABANDONED`
(with reason).
